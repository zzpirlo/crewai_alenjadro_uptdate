**Title:** Russian Civilian Charged with Hacking Ukrainian Government Before Invasion

**Summary:**  Amin Stigal, a 22-year-old Russian civilian, has been charged by federal prosecutors with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion and damage for allegedly hacking Ukrainian government agencies in the months leading up to Russia's 2022 invasion. Prosecutors allege that Stigal, working with co-conspirators linked to the Russian GRU, used malware like "WhisperGate" to disrupt Ukrainian systems and exfiltrate data. They claim he also targeted transportation infrastructure in a central European country supporting Ukraine and probed US government systems in Maryland. A $10 million reward is offered for information leading to Stigal's capture.

**Why this is important:** This case highlights the role of cyberwarfare in modern conflicts and the lengths to which Russia will go to achieve its objectives. It also underscores the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to cyberattacks and the need for robust cybersecurity measures.
